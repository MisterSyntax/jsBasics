    - Used to group statements together. A block is delimted by a pair of curly brackets
    - Commonly used with control flow statements like if, for, while
    - before ES6 no block scope
    - DO NOT DEFINE SCOPE

Conditional Statements- Set of commands that execute if a specified condition is true
    - if...else
        -execute a statement if condition is true
        - optional else if to evaluate additional conditions
        - optional else to evaluate if all else fails
        - Can use block statement after if and else, but optional
        - bad practice to use assignments in condition
            -if you have to, put parens areound statement e.g. if((x=y))//STILL TERRIBLE
