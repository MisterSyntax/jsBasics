//TODO: 

Function Hoisting: Function declarations get hoisted. Not Function expressions;
    /* Function declaration */
    foo(); // "bar"
    function foo() {
        console.log('bar');
    }

    /* Function expression */
    baz(); // TypeError: baz is not a function
    var baz = function() {
        console.log('bar2');
    };
