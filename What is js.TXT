Declarations:
    var - declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value
    let - declares a block scope local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
        - I only want to use the var right here (e.g. a for loop)
    const - Declares a read-only named constant; Must have an initial value

Evaluating Variables. 
    - Declared variables with no var or let are set to undefined
    - An attempt to access an undeclared variable will result in a ReferenceError
        - if "var x;" then "x === undefined" is true

Variable scope:
    - hoisting: Refering to a variable declared later.
        -hoisted variables are undefined until they pass their initial Declarations
        e.g.
        console.log(x);//returns undefined
        var x = 1;
        console.log(x);//returns 1

Undefined:
    - undefined acts as false in boolean context
    - undefined is NaN in numerical context

Null
    - null is false in boolean
    - null is 0 in numerical context
